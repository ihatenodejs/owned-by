# How to self host
1. **Install Bun (`npm` but faster!)**

   **Windows**
   ```
   powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1 | iex"
   ```
   **Linux & macOS**
   ```
   curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
   ```
2. **Install deps**
   ```
   bun install
   ```
3. **Run dev server**
   ```
   bun dev
   ```
   You will now have a server started on port 3000. Simply go to http://localhost:3000 in your browser, and your dev server will build the pages as you make requests.
